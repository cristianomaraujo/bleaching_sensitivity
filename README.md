# Dental Sensitivity Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Objective
To develop a supervised machine learning model to predict the risk and intensity of dental sensitivity in patients undergoing in-office tooth whitening.

## Materials and Methods
This project utilizes retrospective data from 458 patients, incorporating the following variables:
- **Occurrence and intensity of dental sensitivity**: Measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) from 0 to 10.
- **Baseline tooth color**
- **Characteristics of the whitening material**: Concentration and pH.
- **Characteristics of the intervention**: Number and duration of applications.
- **Age**

### Classification Models
